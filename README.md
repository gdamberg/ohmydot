# ohmydot

My personal dotfiles. A work in progress...


## credits

Uses a git bare directory, idea stolen from this blogpost: https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/

Also uses a minimal .bashrc that loads files fom .bashrc.d/ an idea taken from here: https://medium.com/@waxzce/use-bashrc-d-directory-instead-of-bloated-bashrc-50204d5389ff

Name of repo obviously a play on oh-my-zsh, no furter comparision even if i probably have stolen some ideas from plugins found in there...

## install

See blogpost about git bare directory for now...
